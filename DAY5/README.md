# Machine Leanrt Interatomic potentials

in this tutorial we will use three codes, [janus-core](https://github.com/stfc/janus-core), [lammps with mliap](https://www.lammps.org/) and lammps with [symmetryx](https://github.com/wcwitt/symmetrix).

The main aim is to deploy these code on an HPC system, Leonardo at cineca and run simple tasks with them.

Time permitting you can explore scalability of various systems.

While some of the codes can run multigpu, we concentrate here on single gpu only.


running python applications on supercomputers can be challenging we suggest to use [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html) to setup a clean envinronment.
