# Computing beyond Single GPU

There are 3 exercises (and solutions) provided:
* **gromacs-mps**: how to run a GROMACS simulation with and without NVIDIA MPS
* **mandelbrot-acc**: extend mandelbrot code to multi GPU, introducing principles of pipelining and domain decomposition (available in C and FORTRAN)
* **laplace-acc**: extend 2D laplace code to multi GPU, introducing halo exchange (available only in C)


All examples will be also used to show NVIDIA Nsight System capabilities
