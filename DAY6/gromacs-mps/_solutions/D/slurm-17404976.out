NOTE 1 [file unknown]:
  You are using constraints on all bonds, whereas the forcefield has been
  parametrized only with constraints involving hydrogen atoms. We suggest
  using constraints = h-bonds instead, this will also improve performance.

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 22.4%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 58%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 13.0%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.934
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 0.2 %

NOTE: 13.0 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to allow dynamic load balancing (option -dlb auto.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.

NOTE: 25 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      1 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
