NOTE 1 [file unknown]:
  You are using constraints on all bonds, whereas the forcefield has been
  parametrized only with constraints involving hydrogen atoms. We suggest
  using constraints = h-bonds instead, this will also improve performance.

Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was off during the run per user request.
 Average load imbalance: 15.0%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 76%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 11.4%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.279
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 2.5 %

NOTE: 11.4 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to allow dynamic load balancing (option -dlb auto.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
